Description:
  mws:layout generator creates a basic layout, stylesheet and helper.
  The default template contains 978 Grid System's SASS version,
  which allows you to include 978gs mixins in your stylesheets directly:

      .someclass {
        @include grid(12);
        @include first;
        ...
      }
